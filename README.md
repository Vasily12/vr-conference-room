# VR-Conference-Room on the Web

This project was developed as part of an 8 week internship programme at Brunel University London. The project, as titled, involved implementing a virtual reality conference room for up to 10 users/players at a given moment in time. In a sense, this project is different to many other VR projects as it explored the ability creating a virtual environment on the web through the power of [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL).

## Libraries & Frameworks

1. [**A-FRAME**](https://aframe.io/) -> A web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences.
2. [**Instanced-mesh**](https://github.com/diarmidmackenzie/instanced-mesh) -> This library provides a component intends to bring forth a way for A-Frame applications to make use of Three.js [_Instanced Mesh_](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/InstancedMesh) object, while retaining maximum flexibility in how entities are organized within the A-Frame DOM.
3. [**Navigation Mesh**](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-inspector-plugin-recast) -> A plugin for the A-Frame Inspector, allowing creation of a navigation mesh while from an existing A-Frame scene.
4. [**Xr-Starter-Kit**](https://github.com/AdaRoseCannon/aframe-xr-boilerplate) -> This provides **_simple-navmesh-constraint_** which allows you to constrain an object to another object. This component works by comparing the objects position between frames.
5. [**Networked-Aframe**](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe) -> A framework for writing multi-user VR apps in HTML and JS.
